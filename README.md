# MODX Documentation Issues
This project is for managing issues and improving the official [MODX Documentation](http://rtfm.modx.com/). The documentation is not yet in a distributable format and only issues are currently handled on GitHub.

## Creating Issues
### Formatting Your Suggested Edit or Issue Report
Please include the title of the page and the URL of the page from the document at the MODX Documentation site along with a detailed description of the issue or change.

E.g. 

```
Page Title: Creating a Resource Class - Step 2
URL: http://rtfm.modx.com/revolution/2.x/developing-in-modx/advanced-development/custom-resource-classes/creating-a-resource-class/creating-a-resource-class-step-2

Issue: 

There is the same sentence twice at the bottom of the page 
When you try to add a new Copyrighted Resource, however, you will only 
get a white screen! This is normal – we haven't created the controller 
files yet.

Don't worry if you get a white screen when trying to create a 
Copyrighted Resource – we haven't created the controllers yet.
