# MODX Documentation Issues
This project is for managing issues and improving the official [MODX Documentation](http://rtfm.modx.com/). The documentation is not yet in a distributable format and only issues are currently handled on GitHub.

## Creating Issues
### Formatting Your Suggested Edit or Issue Report
Please include the title of the page and the URL of the page from the document at the MODX Documentation site along with a detailed description of the issue or change. This should be automatically populated if you followed the _Suggest an edit_ link on the bottom of the page. 

E.g. 

```
## Page Title
Installation

## URL
http://rtfm.modx.com/revolution/2.x/getting-started/installation

## Issue or Suggestion

There is a typo in the middle of the 3rd paragraph in the word Resource, it should be Resources.
